# Relationship Graph App

> "It is hard for me to understand relationships"

## Motivation
This project is born from a deeply personal need. Navigating the complexities of human connections—understanding how interactions ripple through relationships and tracking the health of bonds over time—can be challenging. This tool is designed to externalize those dynamics, providing a concrete way to visualize, track, and understand the web of relationships in one's life.

## Overview
The Relationship Graph App is a personal relationship management tool that goes beyond simple contact lists. It treats your social circle as a dynamic network, visualizing connections and tracking how events and varied perspectives influence the health of those connections.

## Key Features

### Visual Network Graph
View your social circle as an interactive node-link diagram.
- **Dynamic Visualization**: See how everyone is connected.
- **Interactive Nodes**: Click on individuals to see detailed profiles and histories.

### Relationship Health Tracking
Quantify and monitor the strength of your bonds.
- **Health Scores**: Track relationship health on a scale from -100 to +100.
- **Directional Perspectives**: Capture asymmetric feelings (e.g., how Person A feels about Person B vs. how Person B feels about Person A).
- **Type Tracking**: Distinguish between friends, family, partners, colleagues, and more.

### Event Logging & Impact Analysis
Record the moments that matter and see their effects.
- **Event Tracking**: Log positive interactions (Gifts, Quality Time) and negative ones (Arguments, Neglect).
- **Ripple Effects**: See how a single event involving multiple people can impact various relationships differently.
- **History**: Maintain a timeline of interactions to understand the narrative of each relationship.
